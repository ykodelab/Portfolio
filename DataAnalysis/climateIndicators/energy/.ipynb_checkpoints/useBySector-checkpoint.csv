2,"Data have been revised for 2006 to 2007."
3,"Industry aggregation is at the L-level of the input-output accounts of Statistics Canada. The input-output tables are built around three classification systems, namely the Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC) for industries, the Input-Output Commodity Classification (IOCC) for commodities and the Input-Output Final Demand Classification (IOFDC) for final demand. Each classification has four level of hierarchy, consisting of the 'W' (working) level, the 'L' (historical-link) level, the 'M' (medium) level and the 'S' (small) level. The Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC) is based on the industrial standard of the day, which is currently the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 2002. The IOIC uses a coding scheme that resembles NAICS, but is modified to reflect the hierarchical structure and organization of the IOIC. The NAICS definition of the IOIC classes as well as its hierarchical structure can be found in 'Input-Output Classification' at the following link: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/1401-eng.htm. The hierarchical structure of the Input-Output Commodity Classification (IOCC) and the Input-Output Final Demand Classification (IOFDC) can be found at the same link."
